# General JS library of math, stat, and modeling

* Use of [JSDocs](http://usejsdoc.org/)

* Use of [Random Number Generator Library](https://github.com/mvarshney/simjs-source)

* Use of [D3js Visualization Library](https://d3js.org/)

## Objective & Future Goals

I want to create a well-documented, open / transparent JS-based modeling library focused on statistical and mathematical modeling. I would like the library to integrate easily with D3js. I may make default data returns in D3 format.

#### To-Do

- [ ] Create histogram function
- [ ] Create scatterplot function
- [ ] Create Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) function 

## Dependencies & Setup

#### Install JSDocs
```
    npm install jsdoc
```

* <code>debugPlus.js</code> = enhanced debugger

#### Color Palette

Color-blind friendly palette that has nice black-and-white (gray scale).

```
    # Black, greenish, orangish, lightblue,
    # navy?, darkorange, pink-kinda, yellow!
    #000000
    #009E73
    #e79f00
    #9ad0f3
    #0072B2
    #D55E00
    #CC79A7
    #F0E442
```

#### JS Discrete Event Simulation Library

This is a possible external library to incorporate and / or use as reference.

NOTE: this library provides a host of alternative random number generators.
